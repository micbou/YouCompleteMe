</ul><h2 id="intro">Intro</h2><p>YouCompleteMe is a fast, as-you-type, fuzzy-search code completion engine for
<a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>. It has several completion engines:</p><ul>
<li>an identifier-based engine that works with every programming language,</li>
<li>a <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a>-based engine that provides native semantic code
  completion for C/C++/Objective-C/Objective-C++/CUDA (from now on referred to
  as "the C-family languages"),</li>
<li>a <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd.html">clangd</a>-based <strong>experimental</strong> completion engine for the C-family
  languages.</li>
<li>a <a href="https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi">Jedi</a>-based completion engine for Python 2 and 3,</li>
<li>an <a href="https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-server">OmniSharp</a>-based completion engine for C#,</li>
<li>a combination of <a href="https://github.com/nsf/gocode">Gocode</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Manishearth/godef">Godef</a> semantic engines for Go,</li>
<li>a <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/tree/master/src/server">TSServer</a>-based completion engine for JavaScript and TypeScript,</li>
<li>a <a href="https://github.com/phildawes/racer">racer</a>-based completion engine for Rust,</li>
<li>a <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls">jdt.ls</a>-based experimental completion engine for Java.</li>
<li>and an omnifunc-based completer that uses data from Vim's omnicomplete system
  to provide semantic completions for many other languages (Ruby, PHP etc.).</li>
</ul><p><img alt="YouCompleteMe GIF demo" src="http://i.imgur.com/0OP4ood.gif"/></p><p>Here's an explanation of what happens in the short GIF demo above.</p><p>First, realize that <strong>no keyboard shortcuts had to be pressed</strong> to get the list
of completion candidates at any point in the demo. The user just types and the
suggestions pop up by themselves. If the user doesn't find the completion
suggestions relevant and/or just wants to type, they can do so; the completion
engine will not interfere.</p><p>When the user sees a useful completion string being offered, they press the TAB
key to accept it. This inserts the completion string. Repeated presses of the
TAB key cycle through the offered completions.</p><p>If the offered completions are not relevant enough, the user can continue typing
to further filter out unwanted completions.</p><p>A critical thing to notice is that the completion <strong>filtering is NOT based on
the input being a string prefix of the completion</strong> (but that works too). The
input needs to be a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence">subsequence</a> match</em> of a completion. This is a fancy way
of saying that any input characters need to be present in a completion string in
the order in which they appear in the input. So <code>abc</code> is a subsequence of
<code>xaybgc</code>, but not of <code>xbyxaxxc</code>. After the filter, a complicated sorting system
ranks the completion strings so that the most relevant ones rise to the top of
the menu (so you usually need to press TAB just once).</p><p><strong>All of the above works with any programming language</strong> because of the
identifier-based completion engine. It collects all of the identifiers in the
current file and other files you visit (and your tags files) and searches them
when you type (identifiers are put into per-filetype groups).</p><p>The demo also shows the semantic engine in use. When the user presses <code>.</code>, <code>-&gt;</code>
or <code>::</code> while typing in insert mode (for C++; different triggers are used for
other languages), the semantic engine is triggered (it can also be triggered
with a keyboard shortcut; see the rest of the docs).</p><p>The last thing that you can see in the demo is YCM's diagnostic display features
(the little red X that shows up in the left gutter; inspired by <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic">Syntastic</a>)
if you are editing a C-family file. As the completer engine compiles your file
and detects warnings or errors, they will be presented in various ways. You
don't need to save your file or press any keyboard shortcut to trigger this, it
"just happens" in the background.</p><p>In essence, YCM obsoletes the following Vim plugins because it has all of their
features plus extra:</p><ul>
<li>clang_complete</li>
<li>AutoComplPop</li>
<li>Supertab</li>
<li>neocomplcache</li>
</ul><p><strong>And that's not all...</strong></p><p>YCM also provides <a href="#quick-feature-summary">semantic IDE-like features</a> in a
number of languages, including:</p><ul>
<li>finding declarations, definitions, usages, etc. of identifiers,</li>
<li>displaying type information for classes, variables, functions etc.,</li>
<li>displaying documentation for methods, members, etc. in the preview window,</li>
<li>fixing common coding errors, like missing semi-colons, typos, etc.,</li>
<li>semantic renaming of variables across files,</li>
<li>formatting code,</li>
<li>removing unused imports, sorting imports, etc.</li>
</ul><p>Features vary by file type, so make sure to check out the <a href="#quick-feature-summary">file type feature
summary</a> and the
<a href="#ycmcompleter-subcommands">full list of completer subcommands</a> to
find out what's available for your favourite languages.</p><p>You'll also find that YCM has filepath completers (try typing <code>./</code> in a file)
and a completer that integrates with <a href="https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips/blob/master/doc/UltiSnips.txt">UltiSnips</a>.</p><h2 id="installation">Installation</h2><h3 id="mac-os-x">Mac OS X</h3><p>These instructions (using <code>install.py</code>) are the quickest way to install
YouCompleteMe, however they may not work for everyone. If the following
instructions don't work for you, check out the <a href="#full-installation-guide">full installation
guide</a>.</p><p>Install the latest version of <a href="https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/releases">MacVim</a>. Yes, MacVim. And yes, the <em>latest</em>.</p><p>If you don't use the MacVim GUI, it is recommended to use the Vim binary that is
inside the MacVim.app package (<code>MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim</code>). To ensure it
works correctly copy the <code>mvim</code> script from the <a href="https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/releases">MacVim</a> download to your
local binary folder (for example <code>/usr/local/bin/mvim</code>) and then symlink it:</p><pre><code>ln -s /usr/local/bin/mvim vim
</code></pre><p>Install YouCompleteMe with <a href="https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim#about">Vundle</a>.</p><p><strong>Remember:</strong> YCM is a plugin with a compiled component. If you <strong>update</strong> YCM
using Vundle and the ycm_core library APIs have changed (happens
rarely), YCM will notify you to recompile it. You should then rerun the install
process.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you want C-family completion, you MUST have the latest Xcode
installed along with the latest Command Line Tools (they are installed
automatically when you run <code>clang</code> for the first time, or manually by running
<code>xcode-select --install</code>)</p><p>Install CMake. Preferably with <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>, but here's the <a href="https://cmake.org/download/">stand-alone
CMake installer</a>.</p><p><em>If</em> you have installed a Homebrew Python and/or Homebrew MacVim, see the <em>FAQ</em>
for details.</p><p>Compiling YCM <strong>with</strong> semantic support for C-family languages through
<strong>libclang</strong>:</p><pre><code>cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe

</code></pre><p>Compiling YCM <strong>with</strong> semantic support for C-family languages through
<strong>experimental clangd</strong>:</p><pre><code>cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
./install.py --clangd-completer
</code></pre><p>Note that you can install YCM with both <strong>libclang</strong> and <strong>clangd</strong> enabled. In
that case <strong>clangd</strong> will be preferred unless you have the following in your
<code>vimrc</code>:</p><pre><code class="viml">let g:ycm_use_clangd = 0
</code></pre><p>Compiling YCM <strong>without</strong> semantic support for C-family languages:</p><pre><code>cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe

  <code>--java-completer</code> when calling <code>install.py</code>.</li>
</ul><p>To simply compile with everything enabled, there's a <code>--all</code> flag. Note that
this flag does <strong>not</strong> install <strong>clangd</strong>. You need to specify it manually by
adding <code>--clangd-completer</code>. So, to install with all language features, ensure
<code>xbuild</code>, <code>go</code>, <code>tsserver</code>, <code>node</code>, <code>npm</code>, <code>rustc</code>, and <code>cargo</code> tools are
installed and in your <code>PATH</code>, then simply run:</p><pre><code>cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
./install.py --all
</code></pre><p>That's it. You're done. Refer to the <em>User Guide</em> section on how to use YCM.
Don't forget that if you want the C-family semantic completion engine to work,
you will need to provide the compilation flags for your project to YCM. It's all
in the User Guide.</p><p>YCM comes with sane defaults for its options, but you still may want to take a

guide</a>.</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> we assume that you are using the <code>cmd.exe</code> command prompt and
that you know how to add an executable to the PATH environment variable.</p><p>Make sure you have at least Vim 7.4.1578 with Python 2 or Python 3 support. You
can check the version and which Python is supported by typing <code>:version</code> inside
Vim. Look at the features included: <code>+python/dyn</code> for Python 2 and
<code>+python3/dyn</code> for Python 3. Take note of the Vim architecture, i.e. 32 or
64-bit. It will be important when choosing the Python installer. We recommend
using a 64-bit client. <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">Daily updated installers of 32-bit and 64-bit Vim with
Python 2 and Python 3 support</a> are available.</p><p>Add the line:</p><pre><code>set encoding=utf-8
</code></pre><p>to your <a href="http://vimhelp.appspot.com/starting.txt.html#vimrc">vimrc</a> if not already present. This option is required by YCM. Note
that it does not prevent you from editing a file in another encoding than UTF-8.
You can do that by specifying <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/editing.html#++enc">the <code>++enc</code> argument</a> to the <code>:e</code> command.</p><p>Install YouCompleteMe with <a href="https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim#about">Vundle</a>.</p><p><strong>Remember:</strong> YCM is a plugin with a compiled component. If you <strong>update</strong> YCM
using Vundle and the ycm_core library APIs have changed (happens
rarely), YCM will notify you to recompile it. You should then rerun the install
process.</p><p>Download and install the following software:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/">Python 2 or Python 3</a>. Be sure to pick the version
  corresponding to your Vim architecture. It is <em>Windows x86</em> for a 32-bit Vim
  and <em>Windows x86-64</em> for a 64-bit Vim. We recommend installing Python 3.
  Additionally, the version of Python you install must match up exactly with
  the version of Python that Vim is looking for. Type <code>:version</code> and look at the
  bottom of the page at the list of compiler flags. Look for flags that look
  similar to <code>-DDYNAMIC_PYTHON_DLL=\"python27.dll\"</code> and
  <code>-DDYNAMIC_PYTHON3_DLL=\"python35.dll\"</code>. The former indicates that Vim is
  looking for Python 2.7 and the latter indicates that Vim is looking for
  Python 3.5. You'll need one or the other installed, matching the version
  number exactly.</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Ensure that your version of Vim is <em>at least</em> 7.4.1578 <em>and</em> that it has
    support for Python 2 or Python 3 scripting</strong>.</p>
<p>Inside Vim, type <code>:version</code>. Look at the first two to three lines of output;
it should say <code>Vi IMproved X.Y</code>, where X.Y is the major version of vim. If
your version is greater than 7.4, then you're all set. If your version is
7.4 then look below that where it says, <code>Included patches: 1-Z</code>, where Z
will be some number. That number needs to be 1578 or higher.</p>
<p>If your version of Vim is not recent enough, you may need to <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/wiki/Building-Vim-from-source">compile Vim
from source</a> (don't worry, it's easy).</p>
<p>After you have made sure that you have Vim 7.4.1578+, type the following in
Vim: <code>:echo has('python') || has('python3')</code>. The output should be 1. If
it's 0, then get a version of Vim with Python support.</p>
<p>On Windows, check also if your Vim architecture is 32 or 64-bit. This is
critical because it must match the Python and the YCM libraries
architectures. We recommend using a 64-bit Vim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Install YCM</strong> with <a href="https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim#about">Vundle</a> (or <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen#pathogenvim">Pathogen</a>, but Vundle is a better
    idea). With Vundle, this would mean adding a <code>Plugin
    'Valloric/YouCompleteMe'</code> line to your <a href="http://vimhelp.appspot.com/starting.txt.html#vimrc">vimrc</a>.</p>
<p>If you don't install YCM with Vundle, make sure you have run
<code>git submodule update --init --recursive</code> after checking out the YCM
repository (Vundle will do this for you) to fetch YCM's dependencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Complete this step ONLY if you care about semantic completion support for
    C-family languages. Otherwise it's not necessary.</em></p>
<p><strong>Download the latest version of <code>libclang</code></strong>. Clang is an open-source
compiler that can compile C-family languages. The <code>libclang</code> library it
provides is used to power the YCM semantic completion engine for those
languages. YCM is designed to work with libclang version 7.0.0 or higher.</p>
<p>In addition to <code>libclang</code>, YCM also supports an <strong>experimental</strong>
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd.html">clangd</a>-based completer. You can download the latest version of
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd.html">clangd</a> from <a href="http://llvm.org/releases/download.html">llvm.org releases</a>. Follow Step 4 to learn
how to tell YCM where to find clangd binary. Please note that YCM is
designed to work with <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd.html">clangd</a> version 7.0.0 or higher.</p>
<p>You can use the system libclang or clangd <em>only if you are sure it is
version 7.0.0 or higher</em>, otherwise don't. Even if it is, we recommend using
the <a href="http://llvm.org/releases/download.html">official binaries from llvm.org</a> if at all possible.
Make sure you download the correct archive file for your OS.</p>
<p>We <strong>STRONGLY recommend AGAINST use</strong> of the system libclang or clangd
instead of the upstream compiled binaries. Random things may break. Save
yourself the hassle and use the upstream pre-built libclang or clangd.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compile the <code>ycm_core</code> library</strong> that YCM needs. This library
    is the C++ engine that YCM uses to get fast completions.</p>
<p>You will need to have <code>cmake</code> installed in order to generate the required
makefiles. Linux users can install cmake with their package manager (<code>sudo
apt-get install cmake</code> for Ubuntu) whereas other users can <a href="https://cmake.org/download/">download and
install</a> cmake from its project site. Mac users can also get
it through <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> with <code>brew install cmake</code>.</p>
<p>On a Unix OS, you need to make sure you have Python headers installed. On a
Debian-like Linux distro, this would be <code>sudo apt-get install python-dev
python3-dev</code>. On Mac they should already be present.</p>
<p>On Windows, you need to download and install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/">Python 2 or
Python 3</a>. Pick the version corresponding to your Vim
architecture. You will also need Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) to build YCM.
You can obtain it by installing <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/">Visual Studio</a>.
MSVC 14 (Visual Studio 2015) and 15 (2017) are officially supported.</p>
<p>Here we'll assume you installed YCM with Vundle. That means that the
top-level YCM directory is in <code>~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe</code>.</p>
<p>We'll create a new folder where build files will be placed. Run the
following:</p>
<pre><code>cd ~
mkdir ycm_build
cd ycm_build
</code></pre>
<p>Now we need to generate the makefiles. If you DON'T care about semantic
support for C-family languages or plan to use <strong>experimental</strong> <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd.html">clangd</a>
based completer, run the following command in the <code>ycm_build</code> directory:</p>
<pre><code>cmake -G "&lt;generator&gt;" . ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/cpp
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>&lt;generator&gt;</code> is <code>Unix Makefiles</code> on Unix systems and one of the
following Visual Studio generators on Windows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Visual Studio 14 Win64</code></li>
<li><code>Visual Studio 15 Win64</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Remove the <code>Win64</code> part in these generators if your Vim architecture is
32-bit.</p>
<p>For those who want to use the system version of boost, you would pass
<code>-DUSE_SYSTEM_BOOST=ON</code> to cmake. This may be necessary on some systems
where the bundled version of boost doesn't compile out of the box.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> We <strong>STRONGLY recommend AGAINST use</strong> of the system boost instead
of the bundled version of boost. Random things may break. Save yourself
the hassle and use the bundled version of boost.</p>
<p>If you DO care about semantic support for C-family languages, and want to
use libclang as the provider instead of <strong>experimental</strong> <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd.html">clangd</a>-based
completer then your <code>cmake</code> call will be a bit more complicated. We'll
assume you downloaded a binary distribution of LLVM+Clang from llvm.org in
step 3 and that you extracted the archive file to folder
<code>~/ycm_temp/llvm_root_dir</code> (with <code>bin</code>, <code>lib</code>, <code>include</code> etc. folders right
inside that folder). On Windows, you can extract the files from the
LLVM+Clang installer using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7-zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This <em>only</em> works with a <em>downloaded</em> LLVM binary package, not a
custom-built LLVM! See docs below for <code>EXTERNAL_LIBCLANG_PATH</code> when using a
custom LLVM build.</p>
<p>With that in mind, run the following command in the <code>ycm_build</code> directory:</p>
<pre><code>cmake -G "&lt;generator&gt;" -DPATH_TO_LLVM_ROOT=~/ycm_temp/llvm_root_dir . ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/cpp
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>&lt;generator&gt;</code> is replaced like above.</p>
<p>Now that configuration files have been generated, compile the libraries
using this command:</p>
<pre><code>cmake --build . --target ycm_core --config Release
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>--config Release</code> part is specific to Windows and will be ignored on a
Unix OS.</p>
<p>For those who want to use the system version of libclang, you would pass
<code>-DUSE_SYSTEM_LIBCLANG=ON</code> to cmake <em>instead of</em> the
<code>-DPATH_TO_LLVM_ROOT=...</code> flag.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> We <strong>STRONGLY recommend AGAINST use</strong> of the system libclang instead
of the upstream compiled binaries. Random things may break. Save yourself
the hassle and use the upstream pre-built libclang.</p>
<p>You could also force the use of a custom libclang library with
<code>-DEXTERNAL_LIBCLANG_PATH=/path/to/libclang.so</code> flag (the library would end
with <code>.dylib</code> on a Mac). Again, this flag would be used <em>instead of</em> the
other flags. <strong>If you compiled LLVM from source, this is the flag you should
be using.</strong></p>
<p>Running the <code>cmake</code> command will also place the <code>libclang.[so|dylib|dll]</code> in
the <code>YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd</code> folder for you if you compiled with
clang support (it needs to be there for YCM to work).</p>
<p>If you DO care about semantic support for C-family languages, and want to
use <strong>experimental</strong> <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd.html">clangd</a>-based completer then you need to add
following line to your <code>vimrc</code>:
<code>viml
let g:ycm_clangd_binary_path = "/path/to/clangd"</code>
You need to change <code>/path/to/clangd</code> with the path of binary you downloaded
in step 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>This step is optional.</em></p>
<p>Build the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/regex/">regex</a> module for improved Unicode support and better
performance with regular expressions. The procedure is similar to compiling
the <code>ycm_core</code> library:</p>
<pre><code>cd ~
mkdir regex_build
cd regex_build
cmake -G "&lt;generator&gt;" . ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/cregex
cmake --build . --target _regex --config Release
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>&lt;generator&gt;</code> is the same generator used in the previous step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up support for additional languages, as desired:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>C# support: install <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/">Mono on non-Windows platforms</a>.
  Navigate to <code>YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/OmniSharpServer</code>
  and run</p>
<p>msbuild /property:Configuration=Release /property:Platform="Any CPU" /property:TargetFrameworkVersion=v4.5</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On Windows, be sure that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6319274/how-do-i-run-msbuild-from-the-command-line-using-windows-sdk-7-1">the build utility <code>msbuild</code> is in your

  <code>YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/go</code> and in <strong>both</strong>
  <code>src/github.com/mdempsky/gocode</code> and <code>src/github.com/rogpeppe/godef</code> run</p>
<p>GOPATH=$(realpath ../../../..) go build</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On Windows, first set <code>GOPATH</code> to the absolute path of
  <code>YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/go</code> then run <code>go build</code> in the two
  directories above.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>JavaScript and TypeScript support: install <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node#1-install-nodejs--npm">Node.js and npm</a>,
  navigate to <code>YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd</code> and run
  <code>npm install -g --prefix third_party/tsserver typescript</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rust support: install <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. Navigate to
  <code>YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/racerd</code> and run <code>cargo build
  --release</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Java support: install <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">JDK8 (version 8 required)</a>. Download a
  <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/jdtls/milestones">binary release of eclipse.jdt.ls</a> and extract it to
  <code>YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/eclipse.jdt.ls/target/repository</code>.

continue refining the offered completions based on your input.</p><p>Filtering is "smart-case" and "smart-<a href="https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#diacritic">diacritic</a>" sensitive; if you are
typing only lowercase letters, then it's case-insensitive. If your input
contains uppercase letters, then the uppercase letters in your query must
match uppercase letters in the completion strings (the lowercase letters still
match both). On top of that, a letter with no diacritic marks will match that
letter with or without marks:</p><table>

</table><p>Use the TAB key to accept a completion and continue pressing TAB to cycle
through the completions. Use Shift-TAB to cycle backwards. Note that if you're
using console Vim (that is, not Gvim or MacVim) then it's likely that the
Shift-TAB binding will not work because the console will not pass it to Vim.
You can remap the keys; see the <a href="#options">Options</a> section below.</p><p>Knowing a little bit about how YCM works internally will prevent confusion. YCM
has several completion engines: an identifier-based completer that collects all
of the identifiers in the current file and other files you visit (and your tags
files) and searches them when you type (identifiers are put into per-filetype
groups).</p><p>There are also several semantic engines in YCM. There are libclang-based and
clangd-based completers that provide semantic completion for C-family languages.
There's a Jedi-based completer for semantic completion for Python. There's also
an omnifunc-based completer that uses data from Vim's omnicomplete system to
provide semantic completions when no native completer exists for that language
in YCM.</p><p>There are also other completion engines, like the UltiSnips completer and the
filepath completer.</p><p>YCM automatically detects which completion engine would be the best in any
situation. On occasion, it queries several of them at once, merges the
outputs and presents the results to you.</p><h3 id="client-server-architecture">Client-Server Architecture</h3><p>YCM has a client-server architecture; the Vim part of YCM is only a thin client
that talks to the <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd">ycmd HTTP+JSON server</a> that has the vast majority of
YCM logic and functionality. The server is started and stopped automatically as
you start and stop Vim.</p><h3 id="completion-string-ranking">Completion String Ranking</h3><p>The subsequence filter removes any completions that do not match the input, but
then the sorting system kicks in. It's actually very complicated and uses lots
of factors, but suffice it to say that "word boundary" (WB) subsequence
character matches are "worth" more than non-WB matches. In effect, this means
given an input of "gua", the completion "getUserAccount" would be ranked higher
in the list than the "Fooguxa" completion (both of which are subsequence
matches). A word-boundary character are all capital characters, characters
preceded by an underscore and the first letter character in the completion
string.</p><h3 id="general-semantic-completion">General Semantic Completion</h3><p>You can use Ctrl+Space to trigger the completion suggestions anywhere, even
without a string prefix. This is useful to see which top-level functions are
available for use.</p><h3 id="c-family-semantic-completion">C-family Semantic Completion</h3><p>In order to perform semantic analysis such as code completion, <code>GoTo</code> and
diagnostics, YouCompleteMe uses <code>libclang</code> or <code>clangd</code>. Both of them make use of
clang compiler, sometimes also referred to as llvm. Like any compiler,
clang also requires a set of compile flags in order to parse your code. Simply
put: If clang can't parse your code, YouCompleteMe can't provide semantic
analysis.</p><p>There are 2 methods which can be used to provide compile flags to clang:</p><h4 id="option-1-use-a-compilation-database">Option 1: Use a <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html">compilation database</a></h4><p>The easiest way to get YCM to compile your code is to use a compilation
database.  A compilation database is usually generated by your build system
(e.g. <code>CMake</code>) and contains the compiler invocation for each compilation unit in
your project.</p><p>For information on how to generate a compilation database, see the <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html">clang
documentation</a>. In short:</p><ul>
<li>If using CMake, add <code>-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON</code> when configuring (or
  add <code>set( CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON )</code> to <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>) and copy or
  symlink the generated database to the root of your project.</li>
<li>If using Ninja, check out the <code>compdb</code> tool (<code>-t compdb</code>) in its
  <a href="https://ninja-build.org/manual.html">docs</a>.</li>
<li>If using GNU make, check out <a href="https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear">Bear</a>.</li>
<li>For other build systems, check out
  <a href="#option-2-provide-the-flags-manually"><code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code></a> below. Note that
  <strong>experimental</strong> <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd.html">clangd</a>-based completer doesn't support this option. So it
  (and anything after this point) only applies to <code>libclang</code>-based completer.</li>
</ul><p>If no <a href="#option-2-provide-the-flags-manually"><code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code></a> is found,
YouCompleteMe automatically tries to load a compilation database if there is
one.</p><p>YCM looks for a file named <code>compile_commands.json</code> in the directory of the
opened file or in any directory above it in the hierarchy (recursively); when
the file is found, it is loaded.  YouCompleteMe performs the following lookups
when extracting flags for a particular file:</p><ul>
<li>If the database contains an entry for the file, the flags for that file are
  used.</li>
<li>If the file is a header file and a source file with the same root exists in
  the database, the flags for the source file are used. For example, if the file
  is <code>/home/Test/project/src/lib/something.h</code> and the database contains an entry
  for <code>/home/Test/project/src/lib/something.cc</code>, then the flags for
  <code>/home/Test/project/src/lib/something.cc</code> are used.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if any flags have been returned from the directory containing the
  requested file, those flags are used. This heuristic is intended to provide
  potentially working flags for newly created files.</li>
</ul><p>Finally, YCM converts any relative paths in the extracted flags to absolute
paths. This ensures that compilation can be performed from any Vim working
directory.</p><h4 id="option-2-provide-the-flags-manually">Option 2: Provide the flags manually</h4><p><em>Note that this option doesn't work with <strong>experimental</strong> <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd.html">clangd</a>-based
completer. You can use a <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html#alternatives">compile_flags.txt</a> file instead.</em></p><p>If you don't have a compilation database, or aren't able to generate one,
you have to tell YouCompleteMe how to compile your code some other way.</p><p>Every C-family project is different. It is not possible for YCM to guess what
compiler flags to supply for your project. Fortunately, YCM provides a mechanism
for you to generate the flags for a particular file with <em>arbitrary complexity</em>.
This is achieved by requiring you to provide a Python module which implements a
trivial function which, given the file name as argument, returns a list of
compiler flags to use to compile that file.</p><p>YCM looks for a <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> file in the directory of the opened file or
in any directory above it in the hierarchy (recursively); when the file is
found, it is loaded (only once!) as a Python module. YCM calls a <code>Settings</code>
method in that module which should provide it with the information necessary to
compile the current file. You can also provide a path to a global configuration
file with the
<a href="#the-gycm_global_ycm_extra_conf-option"><code>g:ycm_global_ycm_extra_conf</code></a> option,
which will be used as a fallback. To prevent the execution of malicious code
from a file you didn't write YCM will ask you once per <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> if
it is safe to load. This can be disabled and you can white-/blacklist files. See
the <a href="#the-gycm_confirm_extra_conf-option"><code>g:ycm_confirm_extra_conf</code></a> and
<a href="#the-gycm_extra_conf_globlist-option"><code>g:ycm_extra_conf_globlist</code></a> options
respectively.</p><p>This system was designed this way so that the user can perform any arbitrary
sequence of operations to produce a list of compilation flags YCM should hand
to Clang.</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: It is highly recommended to include <code>-x &lt;language&gt;</code> flag to libclang.
This is so that the correct language is detected, particularly for header files.
Common values are <code>-x c</code> for C, <code>-x c++</code> for C++, <code>-x objc</code> for Objective-C, and
<code>-x cuda</code> for CUDA.</p><p>To give you an impression, if your C++ project is trivial, and your usual
compilation command is: <code>g++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o FILE.o FILE.cc</code>, then the
following <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> is enough to get semantic analysis from
YouCompleteMe:</p><pre><code class="python">def Settings( **kwargs ):
  return {
    'flags': [ '-x', 'c++', '-Wall', '-Wextra', '-Werror' ],
  }
</code></pre><p>As you can see from the trivial example, YCM calls the <code>Settings</code> method which
returns a dictionary with a single element <code>'flags'</code>. This element is a <code>list</code>
of compiler flags to pass to libclang for the current file. The absolute path of
that file is accessible under the <code>filename</code> key of the <code>kwargs</code> dictionary.
That's it! This is actually enough for most projects, but for complex projects
it is not uncommon to integrate directly with an existing build system using the
full power of the Python language.</p><p>For a more elaborate example,
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Valloric/ycmd/66030cd94299114ae316796f3cad181cac8a007c/.ycm_extra_conf.py">see ycmd's own <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code></a>. You should be able to
use it <em>as a starting point</em>. <strong>Don't</strong> just copy/paste that file somewhere and
expect things to magically work; <strong>your project needs different flags</strong>. Hint:
just replace the strings in the <code>flags</code> variable with compilation flags
necessary for your project. That should be enough for 99% of projects.</p><p>You could also consider using <a href="https://github.com/rdnetto/YCM-Generator">YCM-Generator</a> to generate the
<code>ycm_extra_conf.py</code> file.</p><h4 id="errors-during-compilation">Errors during compilation</h4><p>If Clang encounters errors when compiling the header files that your file
includes, then it's probably going to take a long time to get completions.  When
the completion menu finally appears, it's going to have a large number of
unrelated completion strings (type/function names that are not actually
members). This is because Clang fails to build a precompiled preamble for your
file if there are any errors in the included headers and that preamble is key to
getting fast completions.</p><p>Call the <code>:YcmDiags</code> command to see if any errors or warnings were detected in
your file.</p><h4 id="selecting-a-c-family-completion-engine">Selecting a C-family completion engine</h4><p>Currently YCM supports two completion engines for C-family semantic completion.
One libclang-based and an <strong>experimental</strong> <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd.html">clangd</a>-based completer. When in
doubt we recommend using the libclang-based engine. Here is a quick comparison
of the two completer engines:</p><ul>
<li><strong>ycm_extra_conf.py</strong>: Currently clangd does not support <code>ycm_extra_conf.py</code>
    therefore you must have a compilation database, whereas libclang can work
    with both.</li>
<li><strong>Project wide indexing</strong>: Clangd has both dynamic and static index support.
    The dynamic index stores up-to-date symbols coming from any files you are
    currently editing, whereas static index contains project-wide symbol
    information. This symbol information is used for code completion and code
    navigation. Whereas libclang is limited to the current translation unit(TU).</li>
<li><strong>GoTo* </strong>: Clangd provides all the GoTo requests libclang provides and it
    improves those using the above mentioned index information to contain
    project-wide information rather than just the current TU.</li>
<li><strong>Rename</strong>: Clangd can perform semantic rename operations on the current
    file, whereas libclang doesn’t support such functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Code Completion</strong>: Clangd can perform code completions at a lower latency
    than libclang; also, it has information about all the symbols in your
    project so it can suggest items outside your current TU and also provides
    proper <code>#include</code> insertions for those items.</li>
<li><strong>Format Code</strong>: Clangd provides code formatting either for the selected
    lines or the whole file, whereas libclang doesn’t have such functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Clangd has faster reparse and code completion times
    compared to libclang.</li>
</ul><p>Note that for clangd to have some of the above mentioned functionality, you need
to provide a static index. For details on how to do that please have a look at
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd.html#project-wide-indexing">clangd-indexing</a>.</p><p>To enable:</p><ul>
<li>libclang-based completer pass <code>--clang-completer</code></li>
<li><a href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd.html">clangd</a>-based completer pass <code>--clangd-completer</code></li>
</ul><p>to <code>install.py</code> while following the <a href="#installation">installation guide</a>. As
mentioned before, pass <code>--clang-completer</code> when in doubt, since the
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd.html">clangd</a>-based completer is still experimental.</p><h3 id="java-semantic-completion">Java Semantic Completion</h3><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Java support is currently experimental. Please let us know your

By
default, it will pick the version of Python running the <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd">ycmd server</a> and
use its <code>sys.path</code>. While this is fine for simple projects, this needs to be
configurable when working with virtual environments or in a project with
third-party packages. The next sections explain how to do that.</p><h4 id="working-with-virtual-environments">Working with virtual environments</h4><p>A common practice when working on a Python project is to install its
dependencies in a virtual environment and develop the project inside that
environment. To support this, YCM needs to know the interpreter path of the
virtual environment. You can specify it by creating a <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> file
at the root of your project with the following contents:</p><pre><code class="python">def Settings( **kwargs ):
  return {
    'interpreter_path': '/path/to/virtual/environment/python'
  }
</code></pre><p>where <code>/path/to/virtual/environment/python</code> is the path to the Python used
by the virtual environment you are working in. Typically, the executable can be
found in the <code>Scripts</code> folder of the virtual environment directory on Windows
and in the <code>bin</code> folder on other platforms.</p><p>If you don't like having to create a <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> file at the root of
your project and would prefer to specify the interpreter path with a Vim option,
read the <a href="#configuring-through-vim-options">Configuring through Vim options</a>
section.</p><h4 id="working-with-third-party-packages">Working with third-party packages</h4><p>Another common practice is to put the dependencies directly into the project and
add their paths to <code>sys.path</code> at runtime in order to import them. YCM needs to
be told about this path manipulation to support those dependencies. This can be
done by creating a <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> file at the root of the project. This
file must define a <code>Settings( **kwargs )</code> function returning a dictionary with
the list of paths to prepend to <code>sys.path</code> under the <code>sys_path</code> key. For
instance, the following <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code></p><pre><code class="python">def Settings( **kwargs ):
  return {
    'sys_path': [
      '/path/to/some/third_party/package',
      '/path/to/another/third_party/package'
    ]
  }
</code></pre><p>adds the paths <code>/path/to/some/third_party/package</code> and
<code>/path/to/another/third_party/package</code> at the start of <code>sys.path</code>.</p><p>If you would rather prepend paths to <code>sys.path</code> with a Vim option, read the
<a href="#configuring-through-vim-options">Configuring through Vim options</a> section.</p><p>If you need further control on how to add paths to <code>sys.path</code>, you should define
the <code>PythonSysPath( **kwargs )</code> function in the <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> file. Its
keyword arguments are <code>sys_path</code> which contains the default <code>sys.path</code>, and
<code>interpreter_path</code> which is the path to the Python interpreter. Here's a trivial
example that insert the <code>/path/to/third_party/package</code> path at the second
position of <code>sys.path</code>:</p><pre><code class="python">def PythonSysPath( **kwargs ):
  sys_path = kwargs[ 'sys_path' ]
  sys_path.insert( 1, '/path/to/third_party/package' )
  return sys_path
</code></pre><p>A more advanced example can be found in <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/blob/master/.ycm_extra_conf.py">YCM's own
<code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code></a>.</p><h4 id="configuring-through-vim-options">Configuring through Vim options</h4><p>You may find inconvenient to have to create a <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> file at the
root of each one of your projects in order to set the path to the Python
interpreter and/or add paths to <code>sys.path</code> and would prefer to be able to
configure those through Vim options. Don't worry, this is possible by using the
<a href="#the-gycm_extra_conf_vim_data-option"><code>g:ycm_extra_conf_vim_data</code></a> option and
creating a global extra configuration file. Let's take an example. Suppose that
you want to set the interpreter path with the <code>g:ycm_python_interpreter_path</code>
option and prepend paths to <code>sys.path</code> with the <code>g:ycm_python_sys_path</code> option.
Suppose also that you want to name the global extra configuration file
<code>global_extra_conf.py</code> and that you want to put it in your HOME folder. You
should then add the following lines to your vimrc:</p><pre><code class="viml">let g:ycm_python_interpreter_path = ''
let g:ycm_python_sys_path = []
let g:ycm_extra_conf_vim_data = [
  \  'g:ycm_python_interpreter_path',
  \  'g:ycm_python_sys_path'
  \]
let g:ycm_global_ycm_extra_conf = '~/global_extra_conf.py'
</code></pre><p>and create the <code>~/global_extra_conf.py</code> file with the following contents:</p><pre><code class="python">def Settings( **kwargs ):
  client_data = kwargs[ 'client_data' ]
  return {
    'interpreter_path': client_data[ 'g:ycm_python_interpreter_path' ],
    'sys_path': client_data[ 'g:ycm_python_sys_path' ]
  }

setting one of the options. YCM will automatically pick the new values.</p><h3 id="rust-semantic-completion">Rust Semantic Completion</h3><p>Completions and GoTo commands within the current crate and its dependencies

completions if it does not have a native semantic completion engine for your
file's filetype. Vim comes with okayish omnifuncs for various languages like
Ruby, PHP, etc. It depends on the language.</p><p>You can get a stellar omnifunc for Ruby with <a href="http://eclim.org/">Eclim</a>. Just make sure you have
the <em>latest</em> Eclim installed and configured (this means Eclim <code>&gt;= 2.2.*</code> and
Eclipse <code>&gt;= 4.2.*</code>).</p><p>After installing Eclim remember to create a new Eclipse project within your
application by typing <code>:ProjectCreate &lt;path-to-your-project&gt; -n ruby</code> inside vim
and don't forget to have <code>let g:EclimCompletionMethod = 'omnifunc'</code> in your
vimrc. This will make YCM and Eclim play nice; YCM will use Eclim's omnifuncs as
the data source for semantic completions and provide the auto-triggering and
subsequence-based matching (and other YCM features) on top of it.</p><h3 id="writing-new-semantic-completers">Writing New Semantic Completers</h3><p>You have two options here: writing an <code>omnifunc</code> for Vim's omnicomplete system
that YCM will then use through its omni-completer, or a custom completer for YCM
using the <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd/blob/master/ycmd/completers/completer.py">Completer API</a>.</p><p>Here are the differences between the two approaches:</p><ul>
<li>You have to use VimScript to write the omnifunc, but get to use Python to
  write for the Completer API; this by itself should make you want to use the
  API.</li>
<li>The Completer API is a <em>much</em> more powerful way to integrate with YCM and it
  provides a wider set of features. For instance, you can make your Completer
  query your semantic back-end in an asynchronous fashion, thus not blocking
  Vim's GUI thread while your completion system is processing stuff. This is
  impossible with VimScript. All of YCM's completers use the Completer API.</li>
<li>Performance with the Completer API is better since Python executes faster than
  VimScript.</li>
</ul><p>If you want to use the <code>omnifunc</code> system, see the relevant Vim docs with <code>:h
complete-functions</code>. For the Completer API, see <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd/blob/master/ycmd/completers/completer.py">the API docs</a>.</p><p>If you want to upstream your completer into YCM's source, you should use the
Completer API.</p><h3 id="diagnostic-display">Diagnostic Display</h3><p>YCM will display diagnostic notifications for the C-family, C#, Java,
JavaScript, and TypeScript languages. Since YCM continuously recompiles your
file as you type, you'll get notified of errors and warnings in your file as
fast as possible.</p><p>Here are the various pieces of the diagnostic UI:</p><ul>
<li>Icons show up in the Vim gutter on lines that have a diagnostic.</li>
<li>Regions of text related to diagnostics are highlighted (by default, a red
  wavy underline in <code>gvim</code> and a red background in <code>vim</code>).</li>
<li>Moving the cursor to a line with a diagnostic echoes the diagnostic text.</li>
<li>Vim's location list is automatically populated with diagnostic data (off by
  default, see options).</li>
</ul><p>The new diagnostics (if any) will be displayed the next time you press any key
on the keyboard. So if you stop typing and just wait for the new diagnostics to
come in, that <em>will not work</em>. You need to press some key for the GUI to update.</p><p>Having to press a key to get the updates is unfortunate, but cannot be changed
due to the way Vim internals operate; there is no way that a background task can
update Vim's GUI after it has finished running.  You <em>have to</em> press a key. This
will make YCM check for any pending diagnostics updates.</p><p>You <em>can</em> force a full, blocking compilation cycle with the
<code>:YcmForceCompileAndDiagnostics</code> command (you may want to map that command to a
key; try putting <code>nnoremap &lt;F5&gt; :YcmForceCompileAndDiagnostics&lt;CR&gt;</code> in your
vimrc). Calling this command will force YCM to immediately recompile your file
and display any new diagnostics it encounters. Do note that recompilation with
this command may take a while and during this time the Vim GUI <em>will</em> be
blocked.</p><p>YCM will display a short diagnostic message when you move your cursor to the
line with the error. You can get a detailed diagnostic message with the
<code>&lt;leader&gt;d</code> key mapping (can be changed in the options) YCM provides when your
cursor is on the line with the diagnostic.</p><p>You can also see the full diagnostic message for all the diagnostics in the
current file in Vim's <code>locationlist</code>, which can be opened with the <code>:lopen</code> and
<code>:lclose</code> commands (make sure you have set <code>let
g:ycm_always_populate_location_list = 1</code> in your vimrc). A good way to toggle
the display of the <code>locationlist</code> with a single key mapping is provided by
another (very small) Vim plugin called <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/ListToggle">ListToggle</a> (which also makes it
possible to change the height of the <code>locationlist</code> window), also written by
yours truly.</p><h4 id="diagnostic-highlighting-groups">Diagnostic Highlighting Groups</h4><p>You can change the styling for the highlighting groups YCM uses. For the signs
in the Vim gutter, the relevant groups are:</p><ul>
<li><code>YcmErrorSign</code>, which falls back to group <code>SyntasticErrorSign</code> and then
  <code>error</code> if they exist</li>
<li><code>YcmWarningSign</code>, which falls back to group <code>SyntasticWarningSign</code> and then
  <code>todo</code> if they exist</li>
</ul><p>You can also style the line that has the warning/error with these groups:</p><ul>
<li><code>YcmErrorLine</code>, which falls back to group <code>SyntasticErrorLine</code> if it exists</li>
<li><code>YcmWarningLine</code>, which falls back to group <code>SyntasticWarningLine</code> if it
  exists</li>
</ul><p>Note that the line highlighting groups only work when the
<a href="#the-gycm_enable_diagnostic_signs-option"><code>g:ycm_enable_diagnostic_signs</code></a>
option is set. If you want highlighted lines but no signs in the Vim gutter,
ensure that your Vim version is 7.4.2201 or later and set the <code>signcolumn</code>
option to <code>off</code> in your vimrc:</p><pre><code class="viml">set signcolumn=off
</code></pre><p>The syntax groups used to highlight regions of text with errors/warnings:
- <code>YcmErrorSection</code>, which falls back to group <code>SyntasticError</code> if it exists and
  then <code>SpellBad</code>
- <code>YcmWarningSection</code>, which falls back to group <code>SyntasticWarning</code> if it exists
  and then <code>SpellCap</code></p><p>Here's how you'd change the style for a group:</p><pre><code class="viml">highlight YcmErrorLine guibg=#3f0000
</code></pre><h2 id="commands">Commands</h2><h3 id="the-ycmrestartserver-command">The <code>:YcmRestartServer</code> command</h3><p>If the <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd">ycmd completion server</a> suddenly stops for some reason, you can
restart it with this command.</p><h3 id="the-ycmforcecompileanddiagnostics-command">The <code>:YcmForceCompileAndDiagnostics</code> command</h3><p>Calling this command will force YCM to immediately recompile your file
and display any new diagnostics it encounters. Do note that recompilation with
this command may take a while and during this time the Vim GUI <em>will</em> be
blocked.</p><p>You may want to map this command to a key; try putting <code>nnoremap &lt;F5&gt;
:YcmForceCompileAndDiagnostics&lt;CR&gt;</code> in your vimrc.</p><h3 id="the-ycmdiags-command">The <code>:YcmDiags</code> command</h3><p>Calling this command will fill Vim's <code>locationlist</code> with errors or warnings if
any were detected in your file and then open it. If a given error or warning can
be fixed by a call to <code>:YcmCompleter FixIt</code>, then <code>(FixIt available)</code> is
appended to the error or warning text. See the <code>FixIt</code> completer subcommand for
more information.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The absence of <code>(FixIt available)</code> does not strictly imply a fix-it
is not available as not all completers are able to provide this indication. For
example, the c-sharp completer provides many fix-its but does not add this
additional indication.</p><p>The <code>g:ycm_open_loclist_on_ycm_diags</code> option can be used to prevent the location
list from opening, but still have it filled with new diagnostic data. See the
<em>Options</em> section for details.</p><h3 id="the-ycmshowdetaileddiagnostic-command">The <code>:YcmShowDetailedDiagnostic</code> command</h3><p>This command shows the full diagnostic text when the user's cursor is on the
line with the diagnostic.</p><h3 id="the-ycmdebuginfo-command">The <code>:YcmDebugInfo</code> command</h3><p>This will print out various debug information for the current file. Useful to
see what compile commands will be used for the file if you're using the semantic
completion engine.</p><h3 id="the-ycmtogglelogs-command">The <code>:YcmToggleLogs</code> command</h3><p>This command presents the list of logfiles created by YCM, the <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd">ycmd
server</a>, and the semantic engine server for the current filetype, if any.
One of these logfiles can be opened in the editor (or closed if already open) by
entering the corresponding number or by clicking on it with the mouse.
Additionally, this command can take the logfile names as arguments. Use the
<code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code> key (or any other key defined by the <code>wildchar</code> option) to complete the
arguments or to cycle through them (depending on the value of the <code>wildmode</code>
option). Each logfile given as an argument is directly opened (or closed if
already open) in the editor. Only for debugging purposes.</p><h3 id="the-ycmcompleter-command">The <code>:YcmCompleter</code> command</h3><p>This command gives access to a number of additional <a href="#quick-feature-summary">IDE-like
features</a> in YCM, for things like semantic GoTo, type
information, FixIt and refactoring.</p><p>This command accepts a range that can either be specified through a selection in
one of Vim's visual modes (see <code>:h visual-use</code>) or on the command line. For
instance, <code>:2,5YcmCompleter</code> will apply the command from line 2 to line 5. This
is useful for <a href="#the-format-subcommand">the <code>Format</code> subcommand</a>.</p><p>Call <code>YcmCompleter</code> without further arguments for a list of the commands you can
call for the current completer.</p><p>See the <a href="#quick-feature-summary">file type feature summary</a> for an overview of
the features available for each file type. See the <em>YcmCompleter subcommands</em>
section for more information on the available subcommands and their usage.</p><h2 id="ycmcompleter-subcommands">YcmCompleter Subcommands</h2><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> See the docs for the <code>YcmCompleter</code> command before tackling this
section.</p><p>The invoked subcommand is automatically routed to the currently active semantic
completer, so <code>:YcmCompleter GoToDefinition</code> will invoke the <code>GoToDefinition</code>
subcommand on the Python semantic completer if the currently active file is a
Python one and on the Clang completer if the currently active file is a C-family
language one.</p><p>You may also want to map the subcommands to something less verbose; for
instance, <code>nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;jd :YcmCompleter GoTo&lt;CR&gt;</code>
maps the <code>&lt;leader&gt;jd</code> sequence to the longer subcommand invocation.</p><h3 id="goto-commands">GoTo Commands</h3><p>These commands are useful for jumping around and exploring code. When moving
the cursor, the subcommands add entries to Vim's <code>jumplist</code> so you can use
<code>CTRL-O</code> to jump back to where you were before invoking the command (and
<code>CTRL-I</code> to jump forward; see <code>:h jumplist</code> for details). If there is more
than one destination, the quickfix list (see <code>:h quickfix</code>) is populated with
the available locations and opened to full width at the bottom of the screen.

on the current line. Where multiple suggestions are available (such as when
there are multiple ways to resolve a given warning, or where multiple
diagnostics are reported for the current line), the options are presented

the identifier under the cursor. This includes renaming declarations,
definitions and usages of the identifier, or any other language-appropriate
action. The specific behavior is defined by the semantic engine in use.</p><p>Similar to <code>FixIt</code>, this command applies automatic modifications to your source
files. Rename operations may involve changes to multiple files, which may or may
not be open in Vim buffers at the time. YouCompleteMe handles all of this for
you. The behavior is described in <a href="#multi-file-refactor">the following section</a>.</p><p>Supported in filetypes: <code>java, javascript, typescript</code></p><h4 id="multi-file-refactor">Multi-file Refactor</h4><p>When a Refactor or FixIt command touches multiple files, YouCompleteMe attempts
to apply those modifications to any existing open, visible buffer in the current
tab. If no such buffer can be found, YouCompleteMe opens the file in a new
small horizontal split at the top of the current window, applies the change,
and then <em>hides</em> the window. <strong>NOTE:</strong> The buffer remains open, and must be
manually saved. A confirmation dialog is opened prior to doing this to remind
you that this is about to happen.</p><p>Once the modifications have been made, the quickfix list (see <code>:help quickfix</code>)
is populated with the locations of all modifications. This can be used to review
all automatic changes made by using <code>:copen</code>. Typically, use the <code>CTRL-W
&lt;enter&gt;</code> combination to open the selected file in a new split. It is possible to
customize how the quickfix window is opened by using <a href="#the-ycmquickfixopened-autocommand">the <code>YcmQuickFixOpened</code>
autocommand</a>.</p><p>The buffers are <em>not</em> saved automatically. That is, you must save the modified
buffers manually after reviewing the changes from the quickfix list. Changes
can be undone using Vim's powerful undo features (see <code>:help undo</code>). Note
that Vim's undo is per-buffer, so to undo all changes, the undo commands must
be applied in each modified buffer separately.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> While applying modifications, Vim may find files which are already
open and have a swap file. The command is aborted if you select Abort or Quit in
any such prompts. This leaves the Refactor operation partially complete and must
be manually corrected using Vim's undo features. The quickfix list is <em>not</em>
populated in this case. Inspect <code>:buffers</code> or equivalent (see <code>:help buffers</code>)
to see the buffers that were opened by the command.</p><h4 id="the-format-subcommand">The <code>Format</code> subcommand</h4><p>This command formats the whole buffer or some part of it according to the value
of the Vim options <code>shiftwidth</code> and <code>expandtab</code> (see <code>:h 'sw'</code> and <code>:h et</code>
respectively). To format a specific part of your document, you can either select
it in one of Vim's visual modes (see <code>:h visual-use</code>) and run the command or
directly enter the range on the command line, e.g. <code>:2,5YcmCompleter Format</code> to
format it from line 2 to line 5.</p><p>Supported in filetypes: <code>java, javascript, typescript</code></p><h4 id="the-organizeimports-subcommand">The <code>OrganizeImports</code> subcommand</h4><p>This command removes unused imports and sorts imports in the current file. It

<code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> file unless you return them with the <code>do_cache</code> parameter
set to <code>False</code>. It also caches the flags extracted from the compilation
database. The cache is in memory and is never invalidated (unless you restart

completion engines. The option holds a dictionary of key-values, where the keys
are Vim's filetype strings delimited by commas and values are lists of strings,
where the strings are the triggers.</p><p>Setting key-value pairs on the dictionary <em>adds</em> semantic triggers to the
internal default set (listed below). You cannot remove the default triggers,
only add new ones.</p><p>A "trigger" is a sequence of one or more characters that trigger semantic
completion when typed. For instance, C++ (<code>cpp</code> filetype) has <code>.</code> listed as a
trigger. So when the user types <code>foo.</code>, the semantic engine will trigger and
serve <code>foo</code>'s list of member functions and variables. Since C++ also has <code>-&gt;</code>
listed as a trigger, the same thing would happen when the user typed <code>foo-&gt;</code>.</p><p>It's also possible to use a regular expression as a trigger. You have to prefix
your trigger with <code>re!</code> to signify it's a regex trigger. For instance,
<code>re!\w+\.</code> would only trigger after the <code>\w+\.</code> regex matches.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The regex syntax is <strong>NOT</strong> Vim's, it's <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax">Python's</a>.</p><p>Default: <code>[see next line]</code></p><pre><code class="viml">let g:ycm_semantic_triggers =  {

they might not produce all possible results for a given prefix. By unsetting

If this option is set to the <code>'same-buffer'</code> but current buffer can not be
switched (when buffer is modified and <code>nohidden</code> option is set), then result
will be opened in a split. When the option is set to
<code>'split-or-existing-window'</code>, if the result is already open in a window of the

in the <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd">ycmd server</a>. So the magic <code>vim</code> module you could have previously
imported in your <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> files doesn't exist anymore.</p><p>To be fair, importing the magic <code>vim</code> module in extra conf files was never
supported in the first place; it only ever worked by accident and was never a
part of the extra conf API.</p><p>But fear not, you should be able to tweak your extra conf files to continue
working by using the <code>g:ycm_extra_conf_vim_data</code> option. See the docs on that
option for details.</p><h3 id="i-get-importerror-exceptions-that-mention-pyinit_ycm_core-or-initycm_core">I get <code>ImportError</code> exceptions that mention <code>PyInit_ycm_core</code> or <code>initycm_core</code></h3><p>These errors are caused by building the YCM native libraries for Python 2 and

</code></pre><p>If building for Python 3 but loading in Python 2:</p><pre><code>ImportError: dynamic module does not define init function (initycm_core)
</code></pre><p>Setting the <code>g:ycm_server_python_interpreter</code> option to force the use of a
specific Python interpreter for <code>ycmd</code> is usually the easiest way to solve the
problem. Common values for that option are <code>/usr/bin/python</code> and
<code>/usr/bin/python3</code>.</p><h3 id="i-get-a-linker-warning-regarding-libpython-on-mac-when-compiling-ycm">I get a linker warning regarding <code>libpython</code> on Mac when compiling YCM</h3><p>If the warning is <code>ld: warning: path '/usr/lib/libpython2.7.dylib' following -L

CMake and is not an issue. Everything should still work fine.</p><h3 id="i-get-a-weird-window-at-the-top-of-my-file-when-i-use-the-semantic-engine">I get a weird window at the top of my file when I use the semantic engine</h3><p>This is Vim's <code>preview</code> window. Vim uses it to show you extra information about
something if such information is available. YCM provides Vim with such extra
information. For instance, when you select a function in the completion list,
the <code>preview</code> window will hold that function's prototype and the prototypes of
any overloads of the function. It will stay there after you select the
completion so that you can use the information about the parameters and their
types to write the function call.</p><p>If you would like this window to auto-close after you select a completion
string, set the <code>g:ycm_autoclose_preview_window_after_completion</code> option to <code>1</code>
in your <code>vimrc</code> file. Similarly, the <code>g:ycm_autoclose_preview_window_after_insertion</code>
option can be set to close the <code>preview</code> window after leaving insert mode.</p><p>If you don't want this window to ever show up, add <code>set completeopt-=preview</code> to
your <code>vimrc</code>. Also make sure that the <code>g:ycm_add_preview_to_completeopt</code> option
is set to <code>0</code>.</p><h3 id="it-appears-that-ycm-is-not-working">It appears that YCM is not working</h3><p>In Vim, run <code>:messages</code> and carefully read the output. YCM will echo messages to
the message log if it encounters problems. It's likely you misconfigured
something and YCM is complaining about it.</p><p>Also, you may want to run the <code>:YcmDebugInfo</code> command; it will make YCM spew out
various debugging information, including the YCM and <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd">ycmd</a> logfile paths and
the compile flags for the current file if the file is a C-family language file
and you have compiled in Clang support. Logfiles can be opened in the editor
using <a href="#the-ycmtogglelogs-command">the <code>:YcmToggleLogs</code> command</a>.</p><h3 id="sometimes-it-takes-much-longer-to-get-semantic-completions-than-normal">Sometimes it takes much longer to get semantic completions than normal</h3><p>This means that libclang (which YCM uses for C-family semantic completion)
failed to pre-compile your file's preamble. In other words, there was an error
compiling some of the source code you pulled in through your header files. I
suggest calling the <code>:YcmDiags</code> command to see what they were.</p><p>Bottom line, if libclang can't pre-compile your file's preamble because there
were errors in it, you're going to get slow completions because there's no AST
cache.</p><h3 id="ycm-auto-inserts-completion-strings-i-dont-want">YCM auto-inserts completion strings I don't want!</h3><p>If this happens when Vim automatically wraps text then it's a Vim bug that has
been fixed in version 8.0.0127. Update your Vim to this version or later.</p><p>This could also be some mappings that interfere with YCM's internal ones. Make
sure you don't have something mapped to <code>&lt;C-p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;C-x&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;C-u&gt;</code> (in insert
mode).</p><p>YCM <em>never</em> selects something for you; it just shows you a menu and the user has
to explicitly select something. If something is being selected automatically,
this means there's a bug or a misconfiguration somewhere.</p><h3 id="i-get-a-e227-mapping-already-exists-for-blah-error-when-i-start-vim">I get a <code>E227: mapping already exists for &lt;blah&gt;</code> error when I start Vim</h3><p>This means that YCM tried to set up a key mapping but failed because you already
had something mapped to that key combination. The <code>&lt;blah&gt;</code> part of the message
will tell you what was the key combination that failed.</p><p>Look in the <em>Options</em> section and see if any of the default mappings conflict
with your own. Then change that option value to something else so that the
conflict goes away.</p><h3 id="i-get-glibc_2xx-not-found-required-by-libclangso-when-starting-vim">I get <code>'GLIBC_2.XX' not found (required by libclang.so)</code> when starting Vim</h3><p>Your system is too old for the precompiled binaries from llvm.org. Compile

See the full installation guide for help.</p><h3 id="im-trying-to-use-a-homebrew-vim-with-ycm-and-im-getting-segfaults">I'm trying to use a Homebrew Vim with YCM and I'm getting segfaults</h3><p>Something (I don't know what) is wrong with the way that Homebrew configures and
builds Vim. I recommend using <a href="https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/releases">MacVim</a>. Even if you don't like the MacVim GUI,
you can use the Vim binary that is inside the MacVim.app package (it's
<code>MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim</code>) and get the Vim console experience.</p><h3 id="i-have-a-homebrew-python-andor-macvim-cant-compilesigabrt-when-starting">I have a Homebrew Python and/or MacVim; can't compile/SIGABRT when starting</h3><p>You should probably run <code>brew rm python; brew install python</code> to get the latest

then. If you still get problems with this, see <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/issues/18">issue #18</a> for
suggestions.</p><h3 id="i-get-long_bit-definition-appears-wrong-for-platform-when-compiling">I get <code>LONG_BIT definition appears wrong for platform</code> when compiling</h3><p>Look at the output of your CMake call. There should be a line in it like the
following (with <code>.dylib</code> in place of <code>.so</code> on a Mac):</p><pre><code>-- Found PythonLibs: /usr/lib/libpython2.7.so (Required is at least version "2.5")
</code></pre><p>That would be the <strong>correct</strong> output. An example of <strong>incorrect</strong> output would
be the following:</p><pre><code>-- Found PythonLibs: /usr/lib/libpython2.7.so (found suitable version "2.5.1", minimum required is "2.5")
</code></pre><p>Notice how there's an extra bit of output there, the <code>found suitable version
"&lt;version&gt;"</code> part, where <code>&lt;version&gt;</code> is not the same as the version of the
dynamic library. In the example shown, the library is version 2.7 but the second
string is version <code>2.5.1</code>.</p><p>This means that CMake found one version of Python headers and a different
version for the library. This is wrong. It can happen when you have multiple
versions of Python installed on your machine.</p><p>You should probably add the following flags to your cmake call (again, <code>dylib</code>
instead of <code>so</code> on a Mac):</p><pre><code>-DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python2.7 -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/libpython2.7.so
</code></pre><p>This will force the paths to the Python include directory and the Python library
to use. You may need to set these flags to something else, but you need to make
sure you use the same version of Python that your Vim binary is built against,
which is highly likely to be the system's default Python.</p><h3 id="i-get-libpython27a--relocation-r_x86_64_32-when-compiling">I get <code>libpython2.7.a [...] relocation R_X86_64_32</code> when compiling</h3><p>The error is usually encountered when compiling YCM on Centos or RHEL. The full
error looks something like the following:</p><pre><code>/usr/bin/ld: /usr/local/lib/libpython2.7.a(abstract.o): relocation R_X86_64_32 against `a local symbol' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
</code></pre><p>It's possible to get a slightly different error that's similar to the one above.
Here's the problem and how you solve it:</p><p>Your <code>libpython2.7.a</code> was not compiled with <code>-fPIC</code> so it can't be linked into
<code>ycm_core.so</code>.  Use the <code>-DPYTHON_LIBRARY=</code> CMake flag to point it to a <code>.so</code>
version of libpython on your machine (for instance,
<code>-DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/libpython2.7.so</code>). Naturally, this means you'll have
to go through the full installation guide by hand.</p><h3 id="i-see-undefined-symbol-clang_getcompletionfixit-in-the-server-logs">I see <code>undefined symbol: clang_getCompletionFixIt</code> in the server logs.</h3><p>This means that the server is trying to load a version of libclang that is too
old. You need at least libclang 7.0.0. We recommend running the <code>install.py</code>
script without <code>--system-libclang</code> or downloading the <a href="http://llvm.org/releases/download.html">latest prebuilt binaries
from llvm.org</a> when going through the <a href="#full-installation-guide">full installation
guide</a>.</p><h3 id="i-get-fatal-python-error-pythreadstate_get-no-current-thread-on-startup">I get <code>Fatal Python error: PyThreadState_Get: no current thread</code> on startup</h3><p>This is caused by linking a static version of <code>libpython</code> into ycmd's
<code>ycm_core.so</code>.  This leads to multiple copies of the python interpreter loaded
when <code>python</code> loads <code>ycmd_core.so</code> and this messes up python's global state.
The details aren't important.</p><p>The solution is that the version of Python linked and run against must be built
with either <code>--enable-shared</code> or <code>--enable-framework</code> (on OS X).
This is achieved as follows (<strong>NOTE:</strong> for Mac, replace <code>--enable-shared</code>
with <code>--enable-framework</code>):</p><ul>
<li>When building python from source: <code>./configure --enable-shared {options}</code></li>
<li>When building python from pyenv:
  <code>PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-shared" pyenv install {version}</code></li>
</ul><h3 id="installpy-says-python-must-be-compiled-with---enable-framework-wat"><code>install.py</code> says python must be compiled with <code>--enable-framework</code>. Wat?</h3><p>See the previous answer for how to ensure your python is built to support

output of <code>ctags --version</code> should list "Exuberant Ctags". See <a href="https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags">Universal
Ctags</a> for a maintained version.</p><p>Ctags needs to be called with the <code>--fields=+l</code> (that's a lowercase <code>L</code>, not a
one) option because YCM needs the <code>language:&lt;lang&gt;</code> field in the tags output.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/">Exuberant Ctags</a> by default sets language tag for
<code>*.h</code> files as <code>C++</code>. If you have C (not C++) project, consider giving parameter
<code>--langmap=c:.c.h</code> to ctags to see tags from <code>*.h</code> files.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Mac OS X comes with "plain" ctags installed by default. <code>brew install
ctags</code> will get you the Exuberant Ctags version.</p><p>Also make sure that your Vim <code>tags</code> option is set correctly. See <code>:h 'tags'</code> for
details. If you want to see which tag files YCM will read for a given buffer,
run <code>:echo tagfiles()</code> with the relevant buffer active. Note that that function
will only list tag files that already exist.</p><h3 id="ctrl-u-in-insert-mode-does-not-work-while-the-completion-menu-is-visible"><code>CTRL-U</code> in insert mode does not work while the completion menu is visible</h3><p>YCM uses <code>completefunc</code> completion mode to show suggestions and Vim disables

Sadly there's nothing I can do about this.</p><h3 id="my-ctrl-r-mapping-does-not-work-while-the-completion-menu-is-visible">My <code>CTRL-R</code> mapping does not work while the completion menu is visible</h3><p>Vim prevents remapping of the <code>&lt;C-R&gt;</code> key in all <code>&lt;C-X&gt;</code> completion modes
(except the <code>&lt;C-X&gt;&lt;C-N&gt;</code>/<code>&lt;C-X&gt;&lt;C-P&gt;</code> mode which operates in the same mode as
<code>&lt;C-N&gt;</code>/<code>&lt;C-P&gt;</code>) and YCM uses the <code>&lt;C-X&gt;&lt;C-U&gt;</code> (<code>completefunc</code>) mode for
completions. This means that adding <code>&lt;C-R&gt;</code> to any of the <code>g:ycm_key_list_*</code>
options has no effect. You need to use another key.</p><h3 id="ycm-conflicts-with-ultisnips-tab-key-usage">YCM conflicts with UltiSnips TAB key usage</h3><p>YCM comes with support for UltiSnips (snippet suggestions in the popup menu),
but you'll have to change the UltiSnips mappings. See <code>:h UltiSnips-triggers</code> in

visiting a buffer or setting its filetype. You can force YCM to retrieve them by
manually triggering the <code>FileType</code> autocommand:</p><pre><code class="viml">:doautocmd FileType
</code></pre><h3 id="why-isnt-ycm-just-written-in-plain-vimscript-ffs">Why isn't YCM just written in plain VimScript, FFS?</h3><p>Because of the identifier completion engine and subsequence-based filtering.
Let's say you have <em>many</em> dozens of files open in a single Vim instance (I often
do); the identifier-based engine then needs to store thousands (if not tens of
thousands) of identifiers in its internal data-structures. When the user types,
YCM needs to perform subsequence-based filtering on <em>all</em> of those identifiers
(every single one!) in less than 10 milliseconds.</p><p>I'm sorry, but that level of performance is just plain impossible to achieve
with VimScript. I've tried, and the language is just too slow. No, you can't get
acceptable performance even if you limit yourself to just the identifiers in the
current file and simple prefix-based filtering.</p><h3 id="why-does-ycm-demand-such-a-recent-version-of-vim">Why does YCM demand such a recent version of Vim?</h3><p>YCM needs a version of Vim with the timers feature to achieve full
asynchronicity. This feature is available since Vim 7.4.1578.</p><h3 id="nasty-bugs-happen-if-i-have-the-vim-autoclose-plugin-installed">Nasty bugs happen if I have the <code>vim-autoclose</code> plugin installed</h3><p>Use the <a href="https://github.com/Raimondi/delimitMate">delimitMate</a> plugin instead. It does the same thing without
conflicting with YCM.</p><h3 id="is-there-some-sort-of-ycm-mailing-list-i-have-questions">Is there some sort of YCM mailing list? I have questions</h3><p>If you have questions about the plugin or need help, please use the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/ycm-users">ycm-users</a> mailing list, <em>don't</em> create issues on the tracker. The tracker is
for bug reports and feature requests.</p><h3 id="i-get-an-internal-compiler-error-when-installing">I get an internal compiler error when installing</h3><p>This can be a problem on virtual servers with limited memory. A possible
solution is to add more swap memory. A more practical solution would be to force
the build script to run only one compile job at a time. You can do this by
setting the <code>YCM_CORES</code> environment variable to <code>1</code>. Example:</p><pre><code>YCM_CORES=1 ./install.py --clang-completer
</code></pre><h3 id="i-get-weird-errors-when-i-press-ctrl-c-in-vim">I get weird errors when I press <code>Ctrl-C</code> in Vim</h3><p><em>Never</em> use <code>Ctrl-C</code> in Vim.</p><p>Using <code>Ctrl-C</code> to exit insert mode in Vim is a bad idea. The main issue here is
that <code>Ctrl-C</code> in Vim doesn't just leave insert mode, it leaves it without
triggering <code>InsertLeave</code> autocommands (as per Vim docs). This is a bad idea and
is likely to break many other things and not just YCM.</p><p>Bottom line, if you use <code>Ctrl-C</code> to exit insert mode in Vim, you're gonna have a
bad time.</p><p>If pressing <code>&lt;esc&gt;</code> is too annoying (agreed, it is), we suggest mapping it to
something more convenient. On a QWERTY keyboard, a good pick for the <code>&lt;esc&gt;</code> map
is <code>inoremap jk &lt;Esc&gt;</code>. This is right on the home row, it's an incredibly rare
digraph in English and if you ever need to type those two chars in sequence in
insert mode, you just type <code>j</code>, then wait 500ms, then type <code>k</code>.</p><h3 id="why-did-ycm-stop-using-syntastic-for-diagnostics-display">Why did YCM stop using Syntastic for diagnostics display?</h3><p>Previously, YCM would send any diagnostics it would receive from the libclang
semantic engine to Syntastic for display as signs in the gutter, red squiggles
etc. Today, YCM uses its own code to do that.</p><p>Using Syntastic for this was always a kludge. Syntastic assumes its "checker"
plugins behave in a certain way; those assumptions have never fit YCM. For
instance, YCM continuously recompiles your code in the background for C-family
languages and tries to push new diagnostics to the user as fast as possible,
even while the user types.</p><p>Syntastic assumes that a checker only runs on file save ("active" mode) or even
less frequently, when the user explicitly invokes it ("passive" mode). This
mismatch in assumptions causes performance problems since Syntastic code isn't
optimized for this use case of constant diagnostic refreshing.</p><p>Poor support for this use case also led to crash bugs in Vim caused by
Syntastic-Vim interactions (<a href="https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/issues/593">issue #593</a>) and other problems, like
random Vim flickering. Attempts were made to resolve these issues in
Syntastic, but ultimately some of them failed (for various reasons).</p><p>Implementing diagnostic display code directly in YCM resolves all of these
problems. Performance also improved substantially since the relevant code is now
written in Python instead of VimScript (which is very slow) and is tailored only
for YCM's use-cases. We were also able to introduce new features in this area
since we're now not limited to the Syntastic checker API.</p><p>We've tried to implement this in the most backwards-compatible way possible; YCM
options that control diagnostic display fall back to Syntastic options that
control the same concepts if the user has those set.</p><p>Still, some Syntastic-specific configuration you might have had might not
be supported by the new code. Please file issues on the tracker in such
cases; if we find the request to be reasonable, we'll find a way to address it.</p><h3 id="completion-doesnt-work-with-the-c-standard-library-headers">Completion doesn't work with the C++ standard library headers</h3><p>This is caused by an issue with libclang that only affects some operating
systems. Compiling with <code>clang</code> the binary will use the correct default header
search paths but compiling with <code>libclang.so</code> (which YCM uses) does not.</p><p>Mac OS X is normally affected, but there's a workaround in YCM for that specific
OS. If you're not running that OS but still have the same problem, continue
reading.</p><p>The workaround is to call <code>echo | clang -v -E -x c++ -</code> and look at the
paths under the <code>#include &lt;...&gt; search starts here:</code> heading. You should take
those paths, prepend <code>-isystem</code> to each individual path and append them all to
the list of flags you return from your <code>Settings</code> function in your
<code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> file.</p><p>See <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/issues/303">issue #303</a> for details.</p><h3 id="when-i-start-vim-i-get-a-runtime-error-saying-r6034-an-application-has-made-an-attempt-to-load-the-c-runtime-library-incorrectly">When I start vim I get a runtime error saying <code>R6034 An application has made an attempt to load the C runtime library incorrectly.</code></h3><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14552348/runtime-error-r6034-in-embedded-python-application/34696022">CMake and other things seem to screw up the PATH with their own msvcrXX.dll

</code></pre><h3 id="i-hear-that-ycm-only-supports-python-2-is-that-true">I hear that YCM only supports Python 2, is that true?</h3><p><strong>No.</strong> Both the Vim client and the <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd">ycmd server</a> run on Python 2 or 3. If
you are talking about code completion in a project, you can configure the Python
used for your project through a <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> file. See <a href="#python-semantic-completion">the Python
Semantic Completion section</a> for more details.</p><h3 id="on-windows-i-get-e887-sorry-this-command-is-disabled-the-pythons-site-module-could-not-be-loaded">On Windows I get <code>E887: Sorry, this command is disabled, the Python's site module could not be loaded</code></h3><p>If you are running vim on Windows with Python 2.7.11, this is likely caused by a
<a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/717">bug</a>. Follow this
<a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/blob/a27bbdba9bb87fa0e44c8a00d33d46be936822dd/appveyor.bat#L86-L88">workaround</a> or use a different version
(Python 2.7.12 does not suffer from the bug).</p><h3 id="i-cant-complete-python-packages-in-a-virtual-environment">I can't complete Python packages in a virtual environment.</h3><p>This means that the Python used to run <a href="https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi">Jedi</a> is not the Python of the virtual
environment you're in. To resolve this you should create a <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code>
file at the root of your project that sets the <code>interpreter_path</code> option to the
Python of your virtual environment, e.g.</p><pre><code class="python">def Settings(**kwargs):
  return {
    'interpreter_path': '/path/to/virtual/env/bin/python'
  }
</code></pre><p>See <a href="#python-semantic-completion">the Python Semantic Completion section</a> for
more details.</p><h3 id="i-want-to-defer-loading-of-youcompleteme-until-after-vim-finishes-booting">I want to defer loading of YouCompleteMe until after Vim finishes booting</h3><p>In recent versions of Vim, you can install YCM in a folder under
<code>~/.vim/pack/*/opt</code> and then load it once the user is idle via an autocommand:</p><pre><code class="viml">augroup load_ycm
  autocmd!
  autocmd CursorHold, CursorHoldI * :packadd YouCompleteMe
                                \ | autocmd! load_ycm
augroup END
</code></pre><h3 id="ycm-does-not-shut-down-when-i-quit-vim">YCM does not shut down when I quit Vim</h3><p>YCM relies on the <code>VimLeave</code> event to shut down the <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd">ycmd server</a>. Some
plugins prevent this event from triggering by exiting Vim through an autocommand
without using the <code>nested</code> keyword (see <code>:h autocmd-nested</code>). You should
identify which plugin is responsible for the issue and report it to the plugin
author. Note that when this happens, <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd">ycmd</a> will automatically shut itself
down after 30 minutes.</p><h3 id="ycm-does-not-work-with-my-anaconda-python-setup">YCM does not work with my Anaconda Python setup</h3><p>Anaconda is often incompatible with the pre-built libclang used by YCM
and therefore is not supported. The recommended way to solve this is to run
<code>/path/to/real/python install.py</code> (for example <code>/usr/bin/python install.py</code>).</p><p>If you want completion in Anaconda projects, point the <code>interpreter_path</code> option
in your <code>.ycm_extra_conf.py</code> file to the path of your Anaconda Python e.g.</p><pre><code class="python">def Settings(**kwargs):
  return {
    'interpreter_path': '/path/to/anaconda/python'
  }
</code></pre><p>See <a href="#python-semantic-completion">the Python Semantic Completion section</a> for
more details.</p><h3 id="automatic-import-insertion-after-selecting-a-completion-breaks-undo">Automatic import insertion after selecting a completion breaks undo</h3><p>This is a Vim bug fixed in version 8.1.0256. Update your Vim to this version or
later.</p><h3 id="tab-is-already-mapped-to-trigger-completion-in-the-command-line-window"><code>TAB</code> is already mapped to trigger completion in the command-line window</h3><p>Vim automatically maps the key set by the <code>wildchar</code> option, which is <code>TAB</code> by
default, to complete commands in the command-line window. If you would prefer
using this key to cycle through YCM's suggestions without changing the value of
<code>wildchar</code>, add the following to your vimrc:</p><pre><code class="viml">autocmd CmdwinEnter * inoremap &lt;expr&gt;&lt;buffer&gt; &lt;TAB&gt;
      \ pumvisible() ? "\&lt;C-n&gt;" : "\&lt;TAB&gt;"
